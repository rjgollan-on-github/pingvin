= Supersonic flow through a Busemann diffuser

This is example is taken from the paper by Moelder with flow conditions:
[stem]
++++
M_1 = 5.77; \quad M_2 = 3.00; \quad M_3 = 2.48
++++

To run this example, follow the accompanying makefile in order.

First, generate the 2D grid at the opening of the diffuser using gmsh:

> make prep-slice-grid

We then generated a series of cross-sections to provide a bounding wall
for the simulation:

> make prep-xsect

The space-marching simulation relies on the Pingvin program:

> make march

And the output for VTK can be created using:

> make vtk

You can look at the output with Paraview:

> paraview pvnsim/flowfield.vtu

You can clean up the area using the `clean` target:

> make clean
